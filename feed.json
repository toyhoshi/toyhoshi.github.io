Network Load Balancers are fully-managed load balancers that operate at the connection level (Layer-4) and are capable of handling millions of requests at ultra-low latency. Until now, you could use Network Load Balancers with AWS Fargate only with the TCP protocol. With this new integration, you get the simplicity of serverless containers to run applications on Fargate that use the UDP protocol. You can run workloads such as DNS, IoT, real-time media, and syslog while maintaining high throughput at ultra low latency through the Network Load Balancer.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2020/07/31/image-4.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\" ></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"parsys content\">\n<div class=\"aws-text-box section\">\n<div class=\"  \">\n<p>Fargate support for the UDP protocol through a Network Load Balancer is available in Platform Version 1.4 for the Amazon ECS container orchestration service.

With a single command, AWS Copilot creates all infrastructure and artifacts required to run production-ready service on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate, including task definitions, image repositories, and AWS resources like load balancers, deployment pipelines. With AWS Copilot, users can focus on developing their applications rather than setting up infrastructure.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2020/06/24/copilot-help.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Amazon Announces New Command Line Interface Tool AWS Copilot\"></p>\n<div class=\"parsys content\">\n<div class=\"aws-text-box section\">\n<div class=\"  \">\n<p>With AWS Copilot you can launch your service using one of the built in service patterns providing you secure and scalable infrastructure. Once your service is up and running, AWS Copilot has built in commands to easily add more services, infrastructure like databases or Amazon S3 Buckets, or even new deployment environments in different accounts and regions. While getting started and growing your application is important, AWS Copilot wants to make it easy for you to release and operate your application too. AWS Copilot lets you set up a fully functional CI/CD <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS CodePipeline</a> with just two commands to safely deploy through multiple deployment stages. Additionally, you can view all of your services' logs and health in seconds without having to leave your terminal. Finally, with AWS Copilot, you can choose a collaboration model that fits your team. When using AWS Copilot you can work alone or share your application with other users in your AWS account.  </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"aws-text-box section\">\n<div class=\"  \">\n<p>To get started, see the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copilot can deploy applications to AWS Fargate supported regions and is available for download on Mac and Linux <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/wiki/Installation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Connect with us and learn more about the project on our open source <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli-v2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub repository</a>.</li>\n<li>Read about <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-aws-copilot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AWS Copilot</a> on the AWS Containers blog.</li>\n<li>See tutorials with Copilot in our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_Copilot_CLI.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The more workloads you’re managing, the more helpful these tools will be no matter what your IT strategy is.</p>\n<p class=\"\">To understand automation vs. orchestration, it’s helpful to consider each function on its own, first.</p>\n<h2>What is IT automation?</h2>\n<p class=\"\">Automation, generally speaking, means completing a single task or function without human intervention. Executed wisely, automation makes traditionally time-intensive, manual processes more efficient and reliable.</p>\n<p class=\"\">In IT, it’s possible to automate a wide range of processes and tasks, from app deployment and integration, to securing endpoints and creating service tickets, for both on-premise and cloud tasks. In cloud automation, for instance, you might use automation tools and machine learning to dynamically deploy assets to the cloud, manage cloud computing workloads or classify terabytes of images—something our partner, Google Cloud, can help you do.</p>\n<h2>What is orchestration?</h2>\n<p class=\"\">At its core, Orchestration is most akin to managing a large-scale virtual environment or network. Orchestrating the scheduling and integration of automated tasks between complex distributed systems and services—whether on-premise or in the cloud—streamlines and simplifies interconnected workloads, repeatable processes, and operations. Using today’s orchestration tools, you can automate the arrangement, coordination and management of complex computer systems, middleware and services within your computing environment, and direct automated processes to support larger workflows.</p>\n<p class=\"\">With modern IT teams now responsible for managing hundreds to thousands of applications and servers, manual administration simply can’t scale today’s needs. Orchestration is essential for delivering highly available, dynamically scaling, performant applications, and cloud systems, relieving your team of a very heavy burden. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

It is used to build, manage, update and delete infrastructure resources like virtual machines, containers, networking and others using infrastructure as a coding philosophy. Terraform is a vendor agnostic tool and can manage infrastructure for multiple resource providers (for example AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Aviatrix, Heroku, Oracle, etc.).</p>\n<p>In simple terms, if you want to provision a Virtual Private Cloud or an EC2 instance in AWS, you can write a terraform configuration to automate this process rather than doing it manually from AWS console.</p>",
